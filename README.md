# Choice Content

This site focuses on front-end only, utilising HTML5 (semantic layout) and CSS3 to create the structure and style.

I aimed to explore a different look and feel from previous projects, creating a one-page design for a content agency (demo purposes).

The general layout, flat design, colour scheme, font choice and imagery were specifically chosen to reflect this and communicate the brand's fresh-thinking approach through a modern, minimal aesthetic.

Specifically in terms of colour, my intention was to create a sense of luxury and trust, and I feel that the use of subtle golds and greys work well in this implementation.
